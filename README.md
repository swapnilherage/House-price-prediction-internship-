# House-price-prediction-internship-
The sales of the houses are determined on various factors like the location, area, population and 
some of the information to predict the indiviual housing price. In addition to these housing prices, 
the prediction of the housing prices can greatly assist in the prediction of the future housing prices 
of the real estate.This study uses the machine learning algorithms and technology as a research 
methodology to develop a housing price prediction. Many algorithms are used here to effectively 
increase the precentage of the prediction which is considered as the best models in the price 
prediction. This project shows us that the machine learning algorithm based on 
accuracy,consistency out performs the other in the performance of the housing price prediction. 
The project can be created using python(AI/ML),HTML,CSS,JSS.Python is used for writing the 
Machine Learing Algorithms .HTML,CSS and JS is used for designing the front end of the system. 
At last,I can conclude y saying that House Price Prediction system will be very helpful in detecting 
the prices of the houses and keeping the record of the high and low of the prices.So it will help the 
user to know the real price of the property,it could not be used for any fraud means.
